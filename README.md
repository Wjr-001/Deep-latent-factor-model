Abstract

Undirected, high-dimensional, sparse networks, which are frequently encountered problems in industry, are usually described by high-dimensional, symmetric, sparse matrices. Latent factor models are classical methods to extracting useful knowledge from a small amount of known information in highdimensional sparse matrices. As deep learning is widely used in machine learning, deep latent factor models in the form of matrix decomposition are proposed. However, the current multi-level matrix decomposition models are linear in nature. What is more, it is difficult to meet the requirements for symmetry and non-negativity of matrices. In this paper, a nonlinear deep nonnegative symmetric latent factor model is proposed to complete high-dimensional symmetric sparse matrices；The transfer function, which is of nonlinear mapping between multi-layer latent factors, has been introduced to strictly guarantee the non-negativity and symmetry of the target matrix; An iterative optimization algorithm with adaptive step size is designed in order to solve the model more efficiently. Compared with some state-of-the-art latent factor models, the results have shown that the newly proposed method has significant superiority in the completion of high-dimensional symmetric sparse matrix.
